Project 1
Simple site designed to show all the cars towed in Chicago on a given date.  

It pulls from the city of Chicago API using jquery, displaying each vehicle by plate, make, and model. 

I added an animatin that slowly fades the text using keyframes in css.

I would have liked to add borders to each entry for easier reading.  I also would like to replace "undefined" with "no plate", because those entries just referred to cars without a plate.  It was challenge to find an API that worked after experimenting with a lot. Time and lack thereof was a big issue for me this week.
